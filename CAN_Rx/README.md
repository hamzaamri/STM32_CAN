# Stm32CAN
Establish a reliable data communication link between two STM32F407VG microcontrollers via the CAN bus. This setup can be used to simulate a range of applications, such as data exchange in automotive networks, industrial control, and sensor communication, where robustness and noise immunity are critical.
the project contain:
-A fully functional CAN communication link between the two STM32 microcontrollers, capable of reliable data exchange.
-Demonstration of the robustness and efficiency of CAN for short message bursts, even in the presence of noise.
-A working example of message filtering and error handling in a CAN network, illustrating how multiple nodes in a network selectively process messages.
